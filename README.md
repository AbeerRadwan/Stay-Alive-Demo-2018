Abstract

Fires are the accidents that occurs most frequently either by natural disasters or by human-made and which required different methods and techniques for extinguishing according the fire type, meteorological conditions and how much the damage. Home fire is the disaster that likely to experience which requires to increase the fire prevention knowledge to the kids and adult to protect them against these disasters and different situations.
Stay alive, is a virtual reality simulator for home fires, which will focus on showing the different type of fires with multiple scenes and scenarios for extinguishing the fire with objects and tools available around the house, showing the consequences for any action the user will make on the objects around him. Therefore, this will allow the user to increase his Knowledge about fires not just by reading or watching, it is a full experience.
Our product is a game contains two scenarios about home fires with different source of fire and different objects to extinguish the fire including fire extinguisher type. It supports critical thinking because your winning score is based on a timer, and then the player will be able to see if he is in the list of top scores.
The game is on oculus VR works in android mobile phones which are compatible with the VR, and the player should have a Ps4 controller to connect it with the mobile to play.
 
1.1 - Introduction 
Disasters are a huge problem affecting the wellbeing of humans in whole world, they cause several injuries and deaths depending on their neutrality for example, water disasters like Tsunami and floods, have a different effect on the landscape compared to earth disasters including earthquakes, volcanoes and wildfires.
Fires are one of the most frequent accidents that happens in all palaces weather it is at home, school, restaurants or jungles, they cause terrible damages even if the fire is considered relatively small. 

1.2 - Background 
Fire Accidents are assumed to be one of the most likely problems to occur in every committee. As a result, firefighting efforts increasing around the world.
National Fire Protection Association's statistics shows that 81% of the fire accidents were reported from houses [1] where 46% of it were caused by cooking equipment leading to the death of 19% [2]  and 15% of it were caused by heating equipment [3]. Besides that, Smoking was responsible of 9% of the fire accidents leading to 22% of the total death cases [2]
The above fire cases can be decreased if civilians know how to react in the case of fire, whether a fire distinguisher exists on premises or not. 

1.3 - Problem definition 
Fire accidents are increasing, and the civilians need more training to be able to choose the best reaction against fire without hurting themselves or others.   

1.4 - Proposed solution
With all the kind of disasters that occurs around the world and inability of some people to react appropriately to them, we thought of handling this problem by introducing a VR-app called Stay Alive. This tool simulates a disaster around the users’ own environment and teach them to deal with it by a decision-making process. We plan to make this tool available on all android -based VR-headset.

1.5 - Project scope 
Stay Alive is a VR android app that will be compatible with various VR glasses and controllers. It will be designed for all people including the ones who are trained to protect themselves against fire disasters and those are not. It will utilize an interactive experience building and learning by mistake where the user can try different objects in fire scenarios till they find the right way either save themselves or successfully extinguish the fire. Stay alive will focus on everyday home, school and street routines having most common and available tools around them to teach them how to react in these situations in a safe, low cost and without harming themselves. Since it is a VR, it will combine entrainment and education that will improve their critical thinking skills and reaction to these situations.

1.6 - Limitation 
The trainer should have the appropriate H&S  resources, which are: 1) gear VR, 2) wireless controller and a 3) compatible Samsung Galaxy device that can install the oculus app  . In other words, only these devices support our project: (Galaxy Note 5, Galaxy S6/S6 Edge/S6 Edge+, Galaxy S7/S7 Edge, Galaxy S8/S8+, or Galaxy Note 8 is [1]. Moreover, our simulation-based training tool will not be useful for blind people.

1.7 - Objectives 
Our goal is to train people how to react to fire disasters using objects available in house, school, or anywhere in a safe way with less cost and time and we want our project to be:
•	Available for all people 
•	Basic firefighting training 
•	Explore the right way (learn by mistake)
•	Fun and enjoyable 
•	Home simulation accident   
•	Improve critical thinking 
•	Low cost 
•	Safe and harmless 
1.7.1 - Completion criteria 
The project considered complete if we have a working VR software on android store with at least two scenes also with at least two different scenarios for each interactive object in the scene.  
1.7.2 - Success criteria 
It will consider to be successful if it increases the awareness about fire accidents during normal life, reaches large number of people . If it meets the user  satisfaction and expectation and of course if the statistics of the accidents causes by fire and leads to the death or injuries decreased 
1.7.3 - Deliverable 
Our deliverable will be a simulation app that will be installed from Google play store, and will include these features:	
1.	Choosing a scene from multiple fire scenario to face it.
2.	Rescuing and recovering from several injuries caused by fire.
3.	Facing the consequence for the actions.
4.	Get notified and feedback for the action trainer acted in a specific scenario after finishing it, whether positive or negative based on what he/she has acted.

1.8 - Target user	
Stay Alive app is suitable for age group (10 to elderly) and for all people who want to learn how to face fire disasters, there are at least 2 appropriate scenarios for all ages
